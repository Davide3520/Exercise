/*
PROMPT:
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add
up to a given target.


Step 1:  ASK ABOUT EDGE CASE WHEN DEALING WITH INTEGERS

- Are all numbers positive or there can be negative numbers?
- Are there duplicate numbers in the array?
- Will there always be a solution available?
- What do we return if there is no solution available?
- Write out some test case.
